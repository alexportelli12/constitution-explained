## FEATURE:

Improve the landing page layout, content, and structure to create a visually appealing, informative, and action-driven experience. The updated landing page should include sections that express the civic purpose of the platform, its open-source nature, and encourage deeper engagement with the Constitution. The design should be clean, responsive, and optimized for SEO and user retention.
