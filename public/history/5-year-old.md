Long, long ago, Malta was a small island in the big blue sea 🌊. Many different people came to live here and be the boss of Malta.

First came people from far away places like Rome and Africa. They spoke different languages and had different rules. Then came brave knights who wore armor like in fairy tales! ⚔️🛡️ They lived in Malta for a very long time.

After the knights, the British people came. They had big ships ⛵ and wanted Malta to be part of their big family of countries. The British people stayed for a very, very long time - more than 150 years! That's longer than your great-great-grandparents lived.

The people who were born in Malta - the Maltese people - started to feel like they wanted to make their own rules. They loved their special language called Maltese 🗣️, and they wanted to use it more. They also loved going to church and being Catholic ⛪.

## The Fight for Independence 🏁

As the Maltese people grew up, they said "We want to make our own rules! We want to choose our own leaders!" 💪 This made some people very excited, but it took a long time to happen.

Some very brave Maltese people asked the British, "Can we please have our own government?" Sometimes the British said yes ✅, and sometimes they said no ❌. It was like asking your parents if you can stay up late - sometimes they say yes, sometimes they say no!

During a big war, the people of Malta were very, very brave. Bad people in airplanes dropped bombs on Malta 💥, but the Maltese people never gave up! Because they were so brave, they got a special prize called the George Cross 🏅. It's like getting a gold star ⭐ for being the bravest!

A very important man named **George Borg Olivier** worked very hard to help Malta become free. He talked and talked with the British people until they finally said "Yes! Malta can be its own country!" 🎉

## A New Constitution 📋

On September 21, 1964, something very special happened. Malta became its own country! 🇲🇹 This day is called Independence Day, and we still celebrate it every year with fireworks 🎆 and parades 🎪.

Malta got its very first Constitution. Think of a Constitution like the most important rule book 📚 for a whole country! It tells everyone what they can do and what they cannot do. It says that all people should be treated nicely and fairly 🤝.

The Constitution said that Malta was still friends with Britain 👫, and that Queen Elizabeth was still our Queen 👑, even though we could make our own rules. It was like having your own bedroom 🛏️ but still living in the same house as your family 🏠.

Our first Prime Minister was George Borg Olivier - he was like the most important grown-up in charge of Malta! 👨‍💼

## How We Became a Republic 🏛️

After Malta was independent for 10 years, another important man named **Dom Mintoff** became the leader. He said "We don't want to have a Queen anymore. We want Malta to choose its own President!" 🗳️

On December 13, 1974, Malta became a Republic. That means we chose our own President instead of having a Queen 👑➡️👨‍💼. Our first President was a very nice man named **Sir Anthony Mamo**.

This was like moving out of your family's house and getting your own house with your own rules! 🏠➡️🏡 Malta was now completely grown up and could make all its own decisions.

We still stayed friends with other countries 🌍, but now we were completely free to choose what was best for Malta 🆓.

## How the Constitution Changed Over Time ⏰

Just like how you grow up and need different rules as you get bigger 📏, Malta's Constitution has changed many times to make it better!

The grown-ups who make the rules keep adding new good things to the Constitution:

- They said women and men should be treated exactly the same 👩‍🤝‍👨
- They said the air and water should be kept clean 🌱💧
- They said even young people (16 years old) can vote to choose leaders 🗳️👦👧
- They made sure that judges (the people who decide if someone broke the rules) are very fair ⚖️

Malta joined a big group of countries called the European Union in 2004 🇪🇺. It's like joining a big club where all the countries help each other and are friends! 🤝

Today, Malta's Constitution is still the most important rule book 📖 for our country. It keeps changing to make sure everyone in Malta is happy 😊, safe 🛡️, and treated fairly. And that's how our little island became a big, important country with its own special rules! 🏝️✨
