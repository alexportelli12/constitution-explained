# **The Constitutional Journey of Malta: From National Awakening to Republic**

## **Introduction: Setting the Stage: Malta's Unique Identity and the Dawn of National Aspirations**

Malta, a small archipelago strategically positioned in the heart of the Mediterranean, possesses a rich and complex history, profoundly shaped by centuries of foreign dominion. From ancient Phoenician traders and Roman emperors to Arab rulers, Norman conquerors, the Knights of St. John, and brief French occupation, the islands have consistently been a coveted prize.<sup>1</sup> This continuous ebb and flow of external influences has woven a "rich pattern of traditions, beliefs and practices" into the very fabric of Maltese culture, creating a unique identity distinct from its numerous rulers.<sup>1</sup>

The modern Maltese people trace their origins primarily to colonists from Sicily and Calabria who repopulated the islands around the turn of the second millennium, following a period of depopulation.<sup>1</sup> This re-Christianisation laid the groundwork for the evolution of the Maltese language from its Siculo-Arabic roots.<sup>1</sup> Two pillars stand central to this evolving Maltese identity: the Maltese language and Roman Catholicism. The Maltese language, a unique blend reflecting the islands' crossroads history, is descended from Siculo-Arabic, enriched by massive borrowings from Sicilian, Italian, and later, English.<sup>1</sup> Roman Catholicism, deeply ingrained in the national consciousness, is believed to have been established with the shipwreck of Saint Paul the Apostle on Malta, as recounted in the Book of Acts.<sup>1</sup> The Constitution of Malta formally recognizes Roman Catholicism as the state religion.<sup>1</sup> This distinct cultural and linguistic identity formed the bedrock upon which the nascent idea of Malta as a sovereign nation, rather than merely an autonomous territory under foreign rule, would gradually emerge.

## **Chapter 1: Seeds of Sovereignty (19th Century - Early 20th Century)**

The 19th and early 20th centuries marked the initial stirrings of Maltese national consciousness under British rule, characterized by early demands for self-governance and a growing assertion of cultural identity.

### **British Rule and Early Calls for Autonomy**

Malta's formal relationship with Britain began in 1800 when the Maltese, having rebelled against a brief French occupation, voluntarily sought British protection.<sup>2</sup> This arrangement was solidified by the Treaty of Paris in 1814, which officially transformed Malta into a British Crown Colony.<sup>2</sup> The island's strategic location quickly elevated its importance as a critical naval base for the British Empire, particularly during conflicts like the Crimean War and following the opening of the Suez Canal, profoundly shaping its economy and political trajectory.<sup>5</sup>

Early expressions of Maltese self-determination can be traced to the 1802 Declaration of Rights. In this document, the Maltese acknowledged British sovereignty but explicitly made it "subject to certain conditions," signaling an early, albeit conditional, assertion of their rights and a desire for local autonomy.<sup>7</sup> Constitutional changes under British rule were often incremental and, at times, inconsistent. The first formal Constitution was granted in 1835, establishing a nominated Council of Government, a limited advisory body without elected members.<sup>2</sup> Over the subsequent decades, reforms gradually introduced elected members to the Council in 1849, culminating in 1887 with a significant milestone: a Council composed of a majority of Maltese elected members, marking Malta's first experience with representative government.<sup>2</sup> However, these early constitutional gains were often met with resistance from the Church and the Maltese elite, who preferred to cling to their feudal privileges.<sup>5</sup> By the turn of the century, political tensions led to the dismantling of the 1887 constitution, with representative government being revoked altogether in 1903, reverting the island to a more restrictive form of governance akin to the 1849 model.<sup>2</sup>

### **The Language Question: A Struggle for Identity**

The 19th century in Malta was largely dominated by "The Language Question," a fervent and often contentious debate over whether Italian or English should serve as the official language.<sup>4</sup> Italian had historically been the language of administration, education, and the elite, while the British actively sought to spread English as a unifying force, often dismissing Maltese as a mere "vernacular" unsuitable for formal settings.<sup>4</sup> This linguistic struggle was more than a practical debate; it was a profound assertion of a distinct national identity. The consistent efforts by the British to impose English and to downplay historical and cultural connections between the Maltese and Italians, in an attempt to counteract growing Italian irredentism, inadvertently strengthened the resolve of the Maltese people to preserve their unique language.<sup>1</sup> This resistance, particularly against the imposition of English over Italian, demonstrated a nascent desire for cultural self-determination. The eventual official recognition of Maltese as an official language alongside English in 1934 marked a crucial victory for cultural self-determination, solidifying a unique national character that would underpin and fuel later political independence movements.<sup>4</sup> The Maltese language thus became a powerful symbol of cultural resilience and national pride.

A pivotal figure in this linguistic and national awakening was **Mikiel Anton Vassalli** (1764-1829). Known as the "Father of the Maltese Language," Vassalli was instrumental in championing the development and standardization of Maltese, producing early dictionaries and grammar books.<sup>4</sup> His pioneering work was foundational in demonstrating that Maltese was more than just a spoken dialect, setting the stage for its official recognition and its indispensable role in shaping national identity.<sup>4</sup> Another significant, albeit controversial, figure was

**Manwel Dimech** (1860-1921). A radical for his era, Dimech openly advocated for a Malta entirely independent of colonial rule, envisioning a self-sustaining republic.<sup>9</sup> His ideas, though leading to his imprisonment and considered revolutionary at the time, were early expressions of the republican ideal that would much later come to fruition. He is regarded as a visionary by subsequent leaders, including Dom Mintoff.<sup>9</sup>

## **Chapter 2: The Path to Self-Government (1921-1964)**

Malta's journey towards self-government was marked by a turbulent cycle of constitutional progress and regression, ultimately culminating in a determined push for full independence following the Second World War.

### **The 1921 Amery-Milner Constitution: First Taste of Responsible Government**

The early 20th century witnessed growing political aspirations among the Maltese, which, exacerbated by rising bread prices, culminated in the violent Sette Giugno riots on June 7, 1919.<sup>2</sup> During these riots, four Maltese citizens were killed by British troops, a tragic event that dramatically accelerated the demand for greater autonomy.<sup>2</sup> In the aftermath, a newly constituted National Assembly unanimously resolved to formally request a new constitution granting full political and administrative autonomy.<sup>2</sup>

In response to these mounting pressures, London granted self-government to Malta in 1921 through the Amery-Milner Constitution.<sup>5</sup> This constitution introduced a dyarchical system of governance, a dual control arrangement where a Maltese government managed internal affairs, while the British retained control over "reserved matters" such as foreign policy and defense.<sup>7</sup> The new constitutional framework established a bicameral legislature, comprising an elected Legislative Assembly and a Senate.<sup>5</sup> Voting rights were extended to men aged 21 or older who met specific literacy and property qualifications.<sup>11</sup> Under this new self-governing arrangement,

**Joseph Howard** was appointed as Malta's first Prime Minister.<sup>5</sup>

### **Turbulence: Suspensions and Revocations**

The 1921 Constitution proved to be a fragile instrument, susceptible to political and social pressures. It was first suspended in 1930-32 following a severe political-religious clash between the governing Constitutional Party, led by **Lord Gerald Strickland**, and the powerful Roman Catholic Church, which controversially declared voting for the party a mortal sin.<sup>5</sup> The constitution was then fully withdrawn in 1933, primarily due to the Maltese government's decision to allocate budgetary funds for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools, a move that directly defied British attempts to promote English.<sup>5</sup> Consequently, Malta reverted to its previous status as a Crown Colony.<sup>5</sup>

This turbulent, stop-and-go constitutional development, characterized by repeated grants and withdrawals of self-governance, was a defining feature of British rule in Malta. Such a pattern, where constitutions were "successively granted, suspended, and revoked," suggests a hesitant and often reactive approach by the colonial power, rather than a smooth, linear progression towards self-determination.<sup>7</sup> While frustrating and often driven by imperial strategic interests or reactions to local unrest, this instability inadvertently fostered a resilient and increasingly sophisticated political culture in Malta.<sup>12</sup> Each setback, such as the 1933 revocation, served to reinforce the Maltese people's resolve for genuine self-determination, contributing to a "genealogy of democracy" that would ultimately demand full sovereignty rather than mere conditional autonomy.<sup>12</sup> The experience of self-government, even when curtailed, played a significant role in shaping a more pluralistic political landscape in Malta.<sup>12</sup>

### **Post-War Self-Government and the Road to Independence**

The Second World War proved to be a turning point for Malta's independence movement. The island's strategic importance led to intense and prolonged bombing by Axis Powers, yet Malta famously refused to surrender, earning the entire island the George Cross in 1942, Britain's highest civilian decoration, in recognition of the exceptional heroism of the Maltese people.<sup>5</sup> This profound act of resilience and loyalty significantly bolstered the independence movement in the post-war era.<sup>6</sup>

Self-government was granted once more in 1947 with the MacMichael Constitution. This new framework introduced a unicameral parliamentary system, abolishing the Senate, and notably expanded suffrage to include women and all adults over the age of 21.<sup>7</sup> However, crucial areas such as defense and foreign affairs remained "reserved matters" under British control.<sup>11</sup> This constitution, too, experienced instability, being revoked in 1959 before being restored in 1962.<sup>7</sup> The immediate pre-independence period was marked by hardening political polarization between Malta's two major political parties: the Nationalist Party (PN) and the Malta Labour Party (MLP).<sup>6</sup> The PN, led by

**Giorgio Borg Olivier**, championed the cause of full independence while advocating for continued ties with the British Commonwealth.<sup>6</sup> In contrast, the MLP, under the leadership of

**Dom Mintoff**, initially sought integration with the United Kingdom, though this position later evolved towards a policy of non-alignment after independence.<sup>6</sup> A 1956 referendum on integration saw 77% of voters in favor, but a low voter turnout due to a boycott by the Nationalist Party rendered the results inconclusive.<sup>6</sup>

## **Chapter 3: Independence and the Birth of the Republic (1964-1974)**

This chapter details the pivotal moments of Malta gaining full independence and its subsequent transformation into a republic, highlighting the key political figures and the constitutional framework established.

### **The 1964 Independence Constitution**

Malta finally achieved its long-sought independence on September 21, 1964, a momentous occasion that saw the island nation emerge as the "State of Malta" within the British Commonwealth.<sup>5</sup> This significant milestone was preceded by a national referendum in May 1964, where 54.5% of voters approved the new constitution, signaling a clear mandate for self-rule.<sup>6</sup> The 1964 Constitution established a parliamentary democracy, featuring a unicameral House of Representatives elected by universal suffrage.<sup>6</sup> Initially, Queen Elizabeth II remained the Queen of Malta and the Head of State, with her constitutional roles delegated to a Governor-General who exercised executive authority on her behalf.<sup>6</sup>

**George Borg Olivier**, as the resolute leader of the Nationalist Party, played a central role as the primary instigator and negotiator of this Independence Constitution, and he subsequently became the first Prime Minister of independent Malta.<sup>9</sup>

**Sir Maurice Henry Dorman**, who had served as Malta's last colonial Governor, transitioned into the role of the first Governor-General of independent Malta, representing the Queen.<sup>9</sup>

The 1964 Constitution was a foundational document, enshrining a comprehensive set of fundamental rights and freedoms. These included the right to life, liberty, security of the person, the enjoyment of property, freedom of conscience, expression, peaceful assembly, and association.<sup>16</sup> It explicitly prohibited discrimination based on race, place of origin, political opinions, color, creed, or sex.<sup>17</sup> While establishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion, it also guaranteed freedom of conscience and worship, reflecting a balance between national tradition and individual liberties.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, the Constitution included a "Declaration of Principles" in its Chapter II, outlining social and economic rights such as the right to work, education, culture, and gender equality. Although these principles were not directly enforceable in court, they were deemed "fundamental to the governance of the country," serving as guiding aims for the State in its law-making endeavors.<sup>16</sup>

### **The Transition to a Republic (December 13, 1974)**

The early 1970s witnessed a decisive shift in Malta's political landscape. The Malta Labour Party (MLP), under the assertive leadership of **Dom Mintoff**, came to power in 1971 with a strong mandate for change.<sup>7</sup> Mintoff's government embarked on a foreign policy of non-alignment, aggressively asserting Malta's sovereignty on the international stage, notably fostering special friendships with countries like China and Libya.<sup>7</sup> This policy culminated in a pivotal agreement that led to the total withdrawal of all British forces from Malta by March 31, 1979, an event now celebrated annually as Freedom Day.<sup>7</sup>

A defining moment in Malta's constitutional journey occurred on December 13, 1974. Following significant amendments to the Constitution, passed by the Labour government in Parliament, the monarchy was abolished, and Malta was declared a republic within the Commonwealth.<sup>6</sup> This transformation was highly symbolic and substantive, marking Malta's complete severance from its colonial past.

**Sir Anthony Mamo**, who had served as Malta's last Governor-General and was a respected Maltese national, was appointed as the first President of Malta, thereby replacing the British monarch as the Head of State.<sup>9</sup>

The 1974 amendments aimed to further strengthen democracy and secularism within the new republic. They ensured that the Roman Catholic Church no longer held the authority to impose moral or spiritual pressure on voters, a crucial step towards enhancing personal freedoms and the separation of church and state.<sup>21</sup> Additionally, the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, expanding democratic participation, and a Commission on Employment was established to protect citizens from discrimination in government jobs.<sup>24</sup> It is noteworthy that these constitutional changes were debated and approved solely by Parliament, without being subjected to a popular referendum. This approach became a point of contention for the Nationalist Party opposition, with

**George Borg Olivier**, then leader of the Opposition, among the six Nationalist MPs who voted against the modifications. Their opposition was rooted not in the principle of Malta becoming a republic, but in the method of its establishment without direct public scrutiny.<sup>24</sup>

The transition from independence to a republic was not a simple linear progression but a politically charged process, deeply influenced by internal party dynamics and differing visions for Malta's international alignment. The Labour Party's assertive push for a republic and its policy of non-alignment directly contrasted with the Nationalist Party's initial preference for continued close ties with the United Kingdom.<sup>6</sup> This period underscores how foreign policy considerations were integral to domestic constitutional change. The decisive break from the monarchical system, which still symbolized a link to the former colonial power, was a direct consequence of Mintoff's mandate to redefine Malta's place in the world. The parliamentary approval without a referendum, despite opposition concerns, highlights the strong political will behind this constitutional transformation.<sup>24</sup> The subsequent decision by the Nationalist Party to "consolidate" the republic in 1987 demonstrates a pragmatic evolution of political consensus around the new constitutional order.<sup>25</sup> This period in Malta's history illustrates how a nation's constitutional development is often inextricably linked to its geopolitical aspirations and the ideological battles between its leading political forces, leading to significant, sometimes contentious, shifts in its foundational legal framework. Posthumously,

**Manwel Dimech** was recognized by Dom Mintoff, who explicitly stated that when Malta became a Republic, he thought of Dimech, acknowledging him as a prophetic figure who had envisioned an independent republic decades earlier.<sup>9</sup>

## **Chapter 4: Evolution of the Constitution: Amendments and Modernization (1975-Present)**

Since its establishment as a republic in 1974, the Constitution of Malta has proven to be a highly adaptable and evolving document, undergoing numerous amendments to reflect changing societal values, integrate international obligations, and address emerging governance challenges. The frequency and breadth of these changes underscore a continuous national effort to refine democratic principles and strengthen institutional integrity.

### **Table 2: Significant Constitutional Amendments (1975-Present)**

This table details the key constitutional amendments since Malta became a republic, highlighting the Acts that introduced major changes and their impact on the nation's legal and political landscape. These amendments demonstrate the Constitution's dynamic nature, responding to domestic needs and international developments.

### **Major Amendments (1975-2007)**

Following the pivotal republican transition in 1974, Malta's Constitution continued to evolve, adapting to new political realities and international aspirations. Immediate post-republic adjustments included the formal declaration of Malta as a neutral state.<sup>19</sup> This neutrality clause, enshrined in the Constitution, committed Malta to a policy of non-alignment and refusal to participate in any military alliances, a significant foreign policy shift from its previous role as a British military base.<sup>7</sup> This new status was further cemented by the complete withdrawal of British forces by March 31, 1979.<sup>7</sup>

The 1980s saw important electoral reforms. In 1987, Act IV of 1987 introduced a crucial mechanism designed to ensure proportionality in parliamentary representation.<sup>15</sup> This amendment stipulated that if a party secured an absolute majority of votes in a general election but failed to achieve a corresponding parliamentary majority, additional seats would be allocated to that party to ensure a more representative outcome.<sup>15</sup> This reform aimed to address potential disproportionality inherent in the electoral system. Notably, the Nationalist Party, upon returning to power in 1987, chose to consolidate the 1974 Republic, signaling a pragmatic acceptance of the new constitutional order and an embrace of a broader European spirit.<sup>25</sup>

The 1990s brought further advancements in human rights and governance. In 1991, Act XIX of 1991 introduced amendments to Articles 14 and 45, which promoted equal rights for men and women and strengthened general anti-discrimination provisions within the Constitution.<sup>15</sup> Three years later, in 1994, Act IX of 1994 established the Commission for the Administration of Justice (Article 101A), a key body designed to oversee and safeguard the integrity of the judiciary.<sup>20</sup> Electoral mechanisms were further refined in 1996 by Act XI of 1996, which introduced a proportionality mechanism similar to that of 1987, but specifically for scenarios where only two parties achieved parliamentary representation and one secured a relative majority of votes without a parliamentary majority.<sup>15</sup> Towards the end of the millennium, Act III of 2000 brought significant changes to Malta's citizenship laws, notably repealing previous restrictions on dual citizenship, reflecting a more modern approach to nationality.<sup>20</sup> In 2001, Act XIII of 2001 introduced Article 115A, formally establishing Local Councils, thereby initiating a process of decentralization in governance.<sup>20</sup>

The early 2000s were dominated by Malta's aspiration for European Union membership. A pivotal amendment occurred in 2003 with Act V of 2003, which modified Article 65 of the Constitution.<sup>15</sup> This crucial change facilitated Malta's accession to the European Union by allowing Parliament to enact laws in conformity with Malta's international and regional obligations, particularly those assumed under the EU accession treaties.<sup>20</sup> This represented a major constitutional shift, effectively integrating EU law into the national legal order and marking a new chapter in Malta's sovereignty. Malta officially joined the European Union on May 1, 2004.<sup>7</sup> The 2007 Acts XIV and XXI further strengthened governance by establishing the Office of the Ombudsman (Article 64A) and refining electoral divisions, including the important provision that Gozo and other smaller islands would collectively be treated as one electoral division (Article 61A).<sup>15</sup>

### **Significant Reforms (2008-2025)**

The period from 2008 to the present day has seen a continued and often intensive phase of constitutional reform, reflecting Malta's ongoing efforts to modernize its governance, align with international standards, and address contemporary societal demands. While not a direct constitutional amendment, a significant economic integration step occurred on January 1, 2008, when Malta officially adopted the Euro as its currency, a direct consequence of its European Union membership.<sup>7</sup>

In 2011, a notable amendment was introduced through Act XX of 2011, which added Article 20A to the Constitution.<sup>28</sup> This article mandates the State to facilitate the participation of Maltese citizens living abroad in the political, social, economic, and cultural life of Malta.<sup>16</sup> This amendment acknowledges the significant diaspora and seeks to maintain their connection with the homeland.

A landmark advancement in human rights protection occurred in 2014 with Act X of 2014, enacted on April 14.<sup>15</sup> This amendment to Article 45 explicitly expanded anti-discrimination provisions to include sexual orientation and gender identity, a significant step forward in ensuring equality for all citizens.<sup>15</sup> The year 2016 saw further constitutional reforms within the justice sector through Act XLIV of 2016, enacted on July 20.<sup>28</sup> These changes, affecting Articles 66, 96, 96a, 100, 101a, 101b, 107, and 108, aimed at strengthening judicial independence and accountability.<sup>28</sup>

Youth participation in democracy was significantly enhanced in 2018. On March 5, Act IV of 2018 was unanimously approved, lowering the voting age to 16 for all general and European Parliament elections.<sup>28</sup> This made Malta one of the first countries in Europe to grant such extensive voting rights to 16-year-olds. Later that year, on June 18, Act XXII of 2018 amended Article 9 of the Constitution to give formal constitutional recognition to the environment.<sup>28</sup> This enshrined the State's obligation to protect and conserve the environment and its resources for present and future generations, a crucial step in addressing modern ecological challenges.<sup>34</sup> Governance reforms continued into 2019 with Acts III and XXV of 2019, which introduced amendments related to the Attorney General and other appointments.<sup>28</sup> A notable outcome was the creation of the Office of the State Advocate in December 2019, which effectively split the Attorney General's dual roles of prosecution and government advisory.<sup>35</sup>

The year 2020 marked a period of particularly comprehensive judicial and executive reforms, largely enacted in response to recommendations from the Council of Europe's Venice Commission.<sup>15</sup> This series of Acts significantly reshaped the balance of power and enhanced accountability. Act XLIII of 2020, enacted on August 7, brought about a major overhaul of the appointment process for judges and magistrates.<sup>37</sup> Most notably, it introduced a requirement for a two-thirds parliamentary majority for the appointment of the Chief Justice and reduced the Prime Minister's previous powers in judicial appointments, aiming to bolster judicial independence.<sup>15</sup> Concurrently, Act XLIV of 2020, also enacted on August 7, mandated a two-thirds parliamentary majority for the appointment of the President of Malta, further strengthening the office's independence from simple political majorities.<sup>66</sup> Act XLI of 2020, another significant reform from August 7, provided for judicial review of decisions by the Attorney General not to prosecute, enhancing transparency and accountability in the prosecution process.<sup>68</sup> Furthermore, Act XLV of 2020 amended provisions regarding the removal from office of judges, magistrates, the Attorney General, and the State Advocate, requiring a two-thirds parliamentary majority for such removals, thereby providing greater security of tenure.<sup>70</sup> Act LV of 2020, enacted on November 11, specifically addressed the retirement age of judges and magistrates.<sup>37</sup> Lastly, Act XLII of 2020 amended laws regulating the Office of the Ombudsman, also requiring a two-thirds parliamentary majority for both appointment and removal, reinforcing the independence of this crucial oversight body.<sup>74</sup>

The year 2021 saw further strides in democratic representation and governance. Act XX of 2021, enacted on April 20, introduced a groundbreaking gender corrective mechanism into the electoral system.<sup>28</sup> This mechanism allows for the addition of up to twelve seats in the House of Representatives to ensure a minimum 40% representation for the under-represented sex, a significant step towards achieving greater gender equality in political representation.<sup>40</sup> Act XXVI of 2021, enacted on May 28, reformed the procedure for the appointment of the Principal Permanent Secretary and Permanent Secretaries, further refining public service governance.<sup>28</sup> Additionally, Act XII of 2021, on March 30, enacted reforms to appointment powers, amending the Constitution and other related laws.<sup>76</sup>

In 2022, Act XVI of 2022, enacted on November 4, amended the Explosives Ordinance and various Civil Protection Laws, which also included amendments to the Constitution.<sup>42</sup> The specific constitutional impact of this Act, while confirmed, is not detailed in the available information. Similarly, in 2024, Act III of 2024, enacted on February 2, amended various laws relating to Police Arrest and Detention, and also impacted the Constitution.<sup>44</sup> The precise constitutional implications of this Act are also not extensively detailed in the provided materials.

The most recent constitutional developments occurred in June 2025 with Act XVI of 2025, which addressed judicial inefficiencies.<sup>22</sup> This bill proposed several significant changes, including expanding the Constitutional Court, extending the retirement age for judges, and classifying undue delays as judicial misconduct. However, due to the constitutional requirement for a two-thirds majority for most amendments, only one measure successfully passed: the creation of a

**Commissioner for the Standards of the Judiciary**.<sup>22</sup> This new Commissioner is tasked with conducting preliminary investigations into complaints against members of the judiciary, streamlining the disciplinary process.<sup>22</sup> Other significant proposals, such as raising the retirement age for judges from 68 to 70 and increasing the number of sections in the Constitutional Court, failed to pass due to a lack of bipartisan support.<sup>22</sup>

The Maltese Constitution, initially adopted in 1964, has unequivocally proven to be a highly adaptable "living document." It has undergone numerous amendments to reflect evolving societal values, integrate international obligations (especially EU membership), and address complex governance challenges. The sheer frequency and breadth of these changesâranging from fundamental rights and electoral mechanisms to judicial appointmentsâunderscore a continuous national effort to refine democratic principles and institutional integrity. The 2003 amendment for EU accession was particularly transformative, requiring Malta to align its laws with European standards and even rescind its Non-Aligned Movement membership.<sup>49</sup> Similarly, the comprehensive judicial reforms of 2020, often prompted by external recommendations from bodies like the Venice Commission, aimed to reduce executive powers and strengthen judicial independence.<sup>15</sup> This demonstrates a profound commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law, even when reforms are politically challenging, often requiring a two-thirds parliamentary majority for passage.<sup>22</sup> The strength of a constitution lies not merely in its initial drafting but in its capacity for principled evolution, allowing a nation to navigate changing domestic needs and integrate effectively into the international community while preserving its core values. The challenges in achieving consensus for some recent amendments, such as those in 2025, also highlight the ongoing political negotiation inherent in constitutional development.

## **Conclusion: A Living Document: Malta's Enduring Constitutional Legacy**

Malta's journey from a nascent national identity under centuries of foreign rule to a fully sovereign republic with a dynamic and evolving constitution is a compelling testament to its people's enduring spirit and their unwavering pursuit of self-determination. From the early stirrings of national consciousness, fueled by the assertion of the Maltese language, to the tumultuous path of self-governance marked by cycles of progress and setbacks, and ultimately to the decisive moments of independence and republicanism, each chapter has built upon the last, shaping the nation's foundational legal document.

The Constitution of Malta, adopted in 1964 and transformed into a republican charter in 1974, stands as the supreme law of the land, a testament to the nation's commitment to democratic principles and human rights.<sup>3</sup> It reflects Malta's unique values, including its declared neutrality and its active pursuit of peace and social progress through non-alignment, a principle enshrined in its very fabric.<sup>16</sup> The document's adaptability is evident in the numerous amendments it has undergone, addressing everything from electoral proportionality and gender equality to judicial independence and environmental protection.<sup>16</sup>

The process of constitutional reform in Malta is an ongoing dialogue, as demonstrated by the recent June 2025 amendments concerning the judiciary. While not all proposed changes achieved the necessary consensus, the establishment of the Commissioner for the Standards of the Judiciary signals a continued commitment to strengthening democratic institutions and adapting to contemporary challenges.<sup>22</sup> This continuous evolution underscores that Malta's Constitution is not a static artifact but a dynamic, living document, reflecting the aspirations and values of its people as they navigate the complexities of nationhood in the 21st century.
