# 🇲🇹 What is the Constitution?

The Constitution is the **supreme law** of Malta 📜 — it’s like the foundation for how the country is governed 🏛️. It tells us who has power, how they should use it, and what rights all people have. It keeps everything balanced ⚖️ and fair.

## 🧩 Structure and Key Parts:

- **12 Chapters** 📘, including one special one (Chapter XA) about local councils 🏘️

- **4 Schedules** 📄 with official oaths and lists

## 📖 What does it cover?
