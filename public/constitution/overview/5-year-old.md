# 🇲🇹 What is the Constitution?

The Constitution is like the biggest rulebook 📖 Malta has! It tells everyone how to be fair, kind, and safe 😊. It helps the grown-ups who lead Malta (like the President 👩‍⚖️ and Prime Minister 👨‍💼) know what they can and can’t do. It also says what every person in Malta can do, like speaking freely 🗣️ or being treated nicely ❤️.

## 🎉 Fun Facts:
