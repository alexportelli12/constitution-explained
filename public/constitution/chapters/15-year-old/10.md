# Understanding Malta's Public Service Rules

## The Role of the Public Service Commission

- A **Public Service Commission** (PSC) oversees how public officers are hired, disciplined, or dismissed.
- It’s made up of 3–5 members chosen by the President after the Prime Minister consults the Opposition Leader.
- Members can’t be MPs or public officers and must wait 3 years before taking any public role after their term.

## Appointment of Officers

- The PSC makes the key decisions on public service jobs and discipline.
- The Prime Minister can let others carry out these actions, but only if the PSC agrees.
- These decisions must follow fair and clear rules set by the PSC to ensure everything is based on merit.

## Diplomatic and Foreign Posts

- The Prime Minister appoints Malta’s representatives abroad, but only after consulting the PSC.
- Some appointments can be handled by senior officers, as long as the PSC allows it.

## Pensions and Rights

- Most public officers today receive the same state pension as everyone else.
- The Constitution protects pension rights for those who are entitled to one when they retire.
- Pension payments can be reduced if a retiree takes a role that causes a conflict of interest.

## Legal Protection

- The Constitution says courts can’t question how the PSC carries out its duties.
- But in recent years, some court cases involving the PSC have still gone ahead.
