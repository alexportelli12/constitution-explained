# Understanding Malta's Public Service Rules

## The Role of the Public Service Commission

- A **Public Service Commission** (PSC) helps oversee public sector hiring and discipline.
- It’s made up of 3–5 members, chosen by the President after advice from the Prime Minister, who consults the Opposition Leader.
- Members must not be MPs or public officers and cannot take public jobs for 3 years after their term ends.

## Appointment of Officers

- The PSC handles appointments, transfers, and disciplinary actions.
- The Prime Minister can give general directions to the PSC, but these can’t be challenged in court.

## Diplomatic and Foreign Posts

- The PM appoints Malta’s top representatives abroad after consulting the PSC.

## Pensions and Rights

- Retired public officers receive **pension benefits**.
- These rights are protected and can only be reduced by law and with PSC approval.
- If a retiree takes a new job that conflicts with their former role, payments may be limited ⚖️.

## Legal Protection

- Courts cannot investigate whether PSC members or public officers acted correctly under the Constitution.
