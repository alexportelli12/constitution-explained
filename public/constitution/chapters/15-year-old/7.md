# How Malta’s Government Runs Day-to-Day

This chapter explains how the **Executive branch** works — meaning the part of the Government that makes sure laws and decisions are put into action.

## The President

- Has the **executive authority**, but mostly follows advice from the **Cabinet** or **Prime Minister**.
- Can act on their own only in very specific situations (like appointing the Prime Minister or dissolving Parliament).

## Prime Minister and Cabinet

- The **Prime Minister** is appointed by the President based on who has majority support in Parliament.
- The **Cabinet** includes the Prime Minister and other Ministers, each in charge of a specific area (e.g. health, education).
- The Cabinet leads the Government and is responsible to Parliament.

## Temporary Roles

- If Ministers are absent or unwell, others can be temporarily appointed to fill in.
- The Prime Minister can also delegate their duties to another Cabinet member.

## Legal Advisors

- The **Attorney General** handles criminal cases and has independence in legal decisions.
- The **State Advocate** gives legal advice to the Government and also works independently in the public interest.

## Key Support Roles

- **Permanent Secretaries** manage departments and help Ministers.
- The **Principal Permanent Secretary** is the highest-ranking civil servant.
- The **Secretary to the Cabinet** helps organise Cabinet meetings and decisions.

## The Leader of the Opposition

- Chosen based on who leads the biggest non-government party in Parliament.
- Helps hold the Government to account.

## Prerogative of Mercy

- The President can reduce or cancel punishments (like a pardon) — but only after advice from the Cabinet.
