# Malta's Financial System and Oversight Explained

## National Funds

- All government income goes into the **Consolidated Fund** unless a law says it should go elsewhere.
- This fund can only be used if Parliament approves it through a yearly **Appropriation Act** or in special cases like emergencies.

## Budgeting and Spending

- Each year, the **Minister for Finance** presents a national budget.
- If more money is needed during the year, a **supplementary appropriation** is introduced.

## Special Provisions

- If the yearly budget isn’t ready in time, temporary spending can be allowed under **Article 104**.
- The **Contingencies Fund** allows urgent expenses without delay.

## Salaries and Stability

- Important roles (like judges) have their salaries protected. These can't be reduced once set, ensuring independence and fairness 🧑‍⚖️.

## Accountability

- The **Auditor General**, appointed by a two-thirds parliamentary majority, ensures the proper use of public money and reports directly to Parliament.
- The **Deputy Auditor General** supports these duties.
- Both are independent and cannot be controlled by others 🔎.
