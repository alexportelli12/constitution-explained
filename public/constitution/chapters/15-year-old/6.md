## Parliament: Who Makes the Laws and How

### The structure

Parliament is made up of the **President of Malta** and the **House of Representatives**. Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected from different regions of the country using a system called **proportional representation with a single transferable vote** 🗳️.

### Who can be an MP?

- You must be **at least 18 years old** and registered to vote
- You can’t have certain conflicts, like holding government jobs or being bankrupt
- Some people are **disqualified** from serving if they’ve committed serious crimes or are under certain legal restrictions

### Fairness and representation

To make Parliament more balanced:

- If one sex (like women or men) is under 40% of MPs, up to 12 extra MPs may be added from that group
- The goal is equal participation 💪

### Voting and elections

- Voting must be secret and fair
- Ballot papers are designed to be clear even for people who can’t read
- Corruption or foreign interference is strictly forbidden 🚫

### Keeping Parliament in check

- The **Ombudsman** investigates complaints against government departments
- The **Electoral Commission** ensures that voting boundaries and processes are fair
- The **Speaker** and **Deputy Speaker** manage debates and sessions

### Laws and changes

- Parliament has power to make laws, but **certain constitutional changes require a two-thirds vote or even a public referendum**
- Parliament can also regulate its own sessions and operations
