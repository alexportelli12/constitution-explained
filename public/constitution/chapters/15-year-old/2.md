## What Are “Declarations of Principle”?

These are **aspirations** — things the state promises to work toward. You can’t take the government to court for not doing them, but they’re still **very important** when laws are made.

## Key Topics in the Chapter

### 1. Work and Fair Treatment

- Everyone has the right to work 💼
- The state protects workers and ensures **training and rest**
- There are limits on work hours and rules for **paid holidays**
- **Men and women** must be treated equally — including equal pay 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫
- **Children and teens** get special protections at work

### 2. Education

- **Primary education** is **compulsory and free** in state schools
- Students who are capable — even without money — should be able to reach the highest levels of education
- Scholarships and support systems should help them

### 3. Social Welfare

- The state must help people who can’t work or afford basic living
- Workers should have insurance for things like illness, old age, or accidents
- Disabled persons have a right to training and education 🧑‍🦽

### 4. Environment and Culture

- Malta must protect its **landscape, heritage, and environment** 🌊
- This includes clean air, water, and soil, and stopping pollution
- The state must support **arts, science, and culture** 🎨

### 5. Economy and Participation

- The state supports **private businesses, co-ops**, and **craftspeople**
- Citizens living abroad should be able to take part in Maltese life 🌍

## Why It Matters

Even if not enforceable, these principles show what kind of society Malta is working toward: **equal, sustainable, fair, and culturally rich**.
