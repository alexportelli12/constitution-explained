## Key Points on Citizenship

### 1. Rules Set by Law (Article 22)

- Maltese citizenship — how it’s **gained, lost, or renounced** — is controlled by **national law**
- **Dual and multiple citizenship** is allowed under Maltese law 🌍

### 2. The Commonwealth Link (Article 23)

- Citizens of Malta and other Commonwealth nations are all considered **Commonwealth citizens**
- The list of these countries is in the **Fourth Schedule**, and the **President can update it**

### 3. Legal Protections (Article 24)

- Commonwealth or Irish citizens who aren’t Maltese **can’t be charged** in Malta for actions abroad, unless:

  - A non-Commonwealth person (alien) would be charged
  - The act would be a crime in the foreign country if it were treated like a fully foreign state

- Key definitions are provided, like “alien” and “British Protected Person”

### 4. Repealed Articles

- Articles 25–27 and 30–31 were **removed in 2000**
- These used to cover topics like citizenship through birth, marriage, or Parliament’s powers
