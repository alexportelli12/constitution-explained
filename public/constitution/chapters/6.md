#### Article 51 - Establishment of Parliament.

There shall be a Parliament of Malta which shall consist of the President and a House of Representatives.

#### Article 52 - Composition of the House of Representatives.

1.  Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the House of Representatives shall consist of such number of members, being an odd number and divisible by the number of electoral divisions, as Parliament shall from time to time by law determine. Such members shall be elected in the manner provided by or under any law for the time being in force in Malta in equal proportions from the electoral divisions referred to in article 56 of this Constitution, each division returning such number of members, being not less than five and not more than seven as Parliament shall from time to time by law determine; and such members shall be known as "Members of Parliament":
    Provided that where - - at any general election, a political party (hereinafter referred to in this article as the "absolute majority party") obtains in the aggregate more than fifty per centum of all the valid votes cast at that election, as credited to its candidates by the Electoral Commission at the first count of all the votes; or - at a general election which is contested by more than two political parties and in which only candidates of two of such parties are elected, a political party obtains a percentage of all the valid votes cast at such election, as credited to its candidates by the Electoral Commission at the first count of all the votes (hereinafter also referred to in this article as the "relative majority party"), which is greater than that obtained by any one other party (hereinafter referred to in this article as the "minority party"), and the proportion which the number of the elected candidates credited to the absolute majority party or to the relative majority party (as the case may be) represents in relation to the total number of elected members of the House of Representatives is less than the proportion which the number of votes credited to such candidates at the first count of all the votes represents in relation to the total of the votes credited at the same first count of all the votes to all the candidates of all the parties electing candidates, the number of the elected candidates of such party shall be increased (as the case may be) by a number of additional candidates in the circumstances as determined by and in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the General Elections (Sorting of Ballot Papers, Casual Elections and Co-opting) Regulations in the Thirteenth Schedule to the General Elections Act and the Annex to such Schedule (hereinafter referred to as "the relevant regulations") as in force on 30th September 2007 or as subsequently amended or substituted in the manner provided in sub-article (3):
    Provided further that: - in the eventuality of an election result as provided for in sub-paragraph (i) of the first proviso to this subarticle but provided there is only one minority party; or - in the eventuality of an election result as provided for in sub-paragraph (ii) of the first proviso to this sub-article, and the proportion which the number of elected candidates credited to the minority party represents in relation to the total number of elected members of the House of Representatives is less than the proportion which the number of votes credited to all its candidates at the first count of all the votes represents in relation to the total of the votes credited at the same first count of all the votes to all the candidates of all the parties electing candidates, the number of the elected candidates of the minority party shall be increased by a number of additional candidates as determined by the relevant regulations as in force on 30th September 2007 or as subsequently amended or substituted in the manner provided in sub-article (3). In any case as forseen in the first and second proviso to this sub-article, such persons shall be declared by the Electoral Commission to be elected to fill the additional seats created by the said provisos who, being candidates of the party which is to be credited with the additional seats, were credited by the Electoral Commission at the last count with the highest or next higher number of votes without being elected, irrespective of the division in which such highest or higher number of votes occurs.

2.  If any person who is not a member of the House of Representatives is elected to be Speaker of the House he shall, by virtue of holding the office of Speaker, be a member of the House in addition to the other members:
    Provided that in any such case the Speaker shall not be treated as a member of the House for the purpose of establishing the number of votes required to support a bill for any of the purposes of article 66 of this Constitution.

3.  The provisions of Part IV of the General Elections (Sorting of Ballot Papers, Casual Elections and Co-opting) Regulations, in the Thirteenth Schedule to the General Elections Act and the Annex to such Schedule, as in force on the coming into force of this sub- article may only be deleted, amended or substituted by a bill for an Act of Parliament passed in the manner specified in sub-article (2) of article 66 of this Constitution.

#### Article 52A - Additional seats for under represented sex.

1.  If at a general election which is contested by two or more political parties and in which only candidates of two parties are elected or in the eventuality of an election result as provided for in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the proviso to sub-article (1) of article 52 and in the event that the number of Members of Parliament of the under-represented sex, elected by virtue of article 52, inclusive of those members elected at a casual election in terms of the relevant regulations, is less than forty per cent (40%) of all the Members of Parliament, then the number of Members of Parliament shall increase by not more than twelve (12) Members of the under-represented sex:
    Provided that the number of Members of Parliament of the under-represented sex elected by virtue of article 52 added to the members of the under-represented sex elected by virtue of this article shall not exceed forty per cent (40%) of the total number of elected Members of Parliament making up the House. The candidates elected by virtue of this article are to be apportioned equally between the absolute majority party or the relative majority party and the minority party.

2.  Such candidate or candidates belonging to the under represented sex and who are candidates of the party or parties which shall be credited with the additional seats, and which were credited by the Electoral Commission at the last count with the highest or next higher number of votes without being elected, irrespective of the division in which such highest or next higher number of votes occur, shall be declared by the Electoral Commission as elected to fill the additional seats created by sub-article (1):
    Provided that in the event that the number of candidates established under this article is not reached, following the application of the preceding sub-article, such candidates belonging to the under represented sex shall be declared by the Electoral Commission to be elected to fill the remaining additional seats created by this article who, being candidates of the party which is to be credited with the additional seats, were ranked on a national basis by the Electoral Commission with the highest or next higher number of percentage quota obtained on the basis of their respective final count vote before elimination in relation to the quota of the electoral division contested:
    Provided further that in the event that the number of candidates established under this article is not reached as foreseen in this sub-article, the seats thereafter remaining vacant shall be filled by the co-option of a Member or Members by the House and such Member or Members shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of the House as established under article 53, shall not be subject to any disqualifications for membership of the House as provided under article 54 and shall belong to the under-represented sex.

3.  For the purpose of this article, elected and unelected candidates who are identified as gender-neutral persons in their official documentation, shall be counted with the under-represented sex.

3.  It shall be the duty of the Electoral Commission to suspend the election, either in all electoral divisions or in any one or more of such divisions, if it has reasonable ground to believe that illegal or corrupt practices or other offences connected with the elections have been committed or there has been foreign interference and such practices, offences or interference have so extensively prevailed or have been of such nature that they may reasonably be expected to affect the result of the election, in all or in any one or more of the electoral divisions.
4.  In any case in which an election is suspended under sub- article (3) of this article, the Chief Electoral Commissioner shall forthwith refer the matter to the Constitutional Court for its decision.
5.  Where any of the grounds on which an election may be suspended under sub-article (3) of this article exist and the election has not been suspended, or where illegal or corrupt practices or other offences or foreign interference as are referred to in that sub- article may reasonably be supposed to have affected the result of an election, in all or in any one or more of the electoral divisions, any person entitled to vote at that election may, not later than three days after the publication of the official result of the election, refer the matter to the Constitutional Court for its decision.
6.  Any reference to the Constitutional Court under either sub- article (4) or sub-article (5) of this article shall be made and shall be determined by that Court in accordance with any law for the time being in force in Malta. On any such reference the Court shall, without prejudice to any other powers, have power to annul the election, in all or in any one or more of the electoral divisions, on any of the grounds mentioned in the said sub-articles, and to give such directions and orders and to provide such redress and other remedies as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances and in particular to ensure that a free election, in place of any one that may have been annulled, be he ld at the earliest possible opportunity.
7.  Where an election has been annulled under sub-article (6) of this article, the result of the election shall not be complete before the publication of the official result of a valid election in all electoral divisions.
8.  Except by a bill for an Act of Parliament passed in the manner specified in sub-article (2) of article 66 of this Constitution, no alteration in any law shall be made -
    - whereby any act or omission shall cease to be an illegal or corrupt practice or other offence relating to the election of members of the House of Representatives or foreign interference; or
    - which alters or adds to the circumstances or conditions in which or under which an act or omission is such a practice or other offence or foreign interference; or
    - reduces the punishment to which from time to time any such practice or other offence or interference renders the offender liable; and for the purposes of this sub-article the provisions of sub-article (7) of article 66 of this Constitution shall apply as if references to the alteration to any of the provisions of this Constitution were references to the alteration of any law.
9.  No person shall vote at the election of members of the House of Representatives for any electoral division who is not registered under any law for the time being in force in Malta as a voter in that division.

    Provided that where a person is by reason of blindness unable to mark on his ballot paper, provision may be made by law requiring that at the request of any such person adequate and special means are to be provided which will enable that person to mark on his ballot paper independently and without the need of assistance.
11. Ballot papers shall be drawn up in such a manner as to enable illiterates to distinguish between the political parties to which candidates belong.
12. Candidates and their agents shall be given facilities to watch the transportation of ballot boxes and the sealing and unsealing thereof.
13. The expressions "corrupt practice", "offences connected with the election of members of the House of Representatives" and "foreign interference" have the meaning assigned to them by a law for the time being in force regulating the conduct of elections or foreign interference with respect to elections, and any such law shall be deemed for the purposes of this article and of articles 32 to 47 (inclusive) of this Constitution to be reasonably required in the interest of public order and reasonably justifiable in a democratic society.

3. For the purposes of paragraph (b) of subarticle (2) of this article, when calculating the number of voters in each electoral division on the Island of Malta the total number of electoral divisions shall be the number of electoral divisions established by article 17 of the General Elections Act minus one.
