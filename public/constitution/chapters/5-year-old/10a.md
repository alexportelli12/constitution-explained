## Little Town Helpers 🏡

### What are local councils?

In Malta and Gozo, there are special groups of grown-ups who help in towns and villages 🧹🌼. They are called **local councils**!

### What do they do?

These helpers:

- Keep the streets clean 🧽
- Look after parks 🌳
- Help make decisions for the town

The big people in Parliament decide what jobs these helpers can do.
