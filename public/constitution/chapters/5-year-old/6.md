## The Big Rule-Making House

### A story about Malta’s special house

In Malta, there’s a big important place called **Parliament**. It’s where grown-ups go to make big rules for everyone. It has lots of members called **Members of Parliament** — they talk, think, and vote on ideas to help people. 🧑‍⚖️👩‍🏫

Sometimes, there aren’t enough girls or boys in the group, so special seats are added to keep things fair. 😊

Here are some fun facts:

- To be in Parliament, you must be at least **18 years old** 🎂
- You can’t be in trouble or have big jobs that might mix things up 🤔
- People vote in special ways so it's super fair 🗳️
- There’s a person called the **Speaker** who makes sure everyone takes turns talking 🎤

Oh! And there’s someone called the **Ombudsman** who checks if the people in charge are being fair to everyone 🕵️
