## Who Helps Malta Work Every Day 🏛️

### Special helpers for Malta

Malta has many people who help run the country every day — like teachers, police 👮, and helpers in offices 🧑‍💼. They are called **public officers**.

### Who chooses these helpers?

A special team called the **Public Service Commission** helps choose the right people. They make sure everything is fair 😊.

### Taking care of helpers

- Helpers can get a thank-you gift when they stop working called a **pension** 🎁.
- If someone gets another job after retiring, they must make sure there's no problem with their old one.

### Nobody can check the helpers' boss

The courts are not allowed to ask if the Commission or helpers did their job right — the rules say we must trust them.
