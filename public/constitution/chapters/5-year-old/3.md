## How Do People Become Citizens?

- Malta has special rules that say who can be a citizen
- People can sometimes belong to **two countries at once** — that’s okay too 🌍

## What Is the Commonwealth?

- Malta is part of a group of countries called the **Commonwealth**
- People from those countries are called **Commonwealth citizens** and can be treated in a friendly way 🤝

## About Rules

- If someone from another country does something wrong, Malta checks the rules carefully
- They’re not in trouble unless the same thing would be wrong for other people too ⚖️
