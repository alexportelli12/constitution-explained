# Malta's Big Promises

## Helping Everyone Have a Good Life

This chapter is like Malta saying, “We want to help everyone grow, learn, and be treated kindly” 😊. These are big promises the country makes to take care of people, nature, and fair work.

## What Malta Wants to Do

- Make sure everyone can find work and learn new skills 💼
- Help kids go to school for free 📚
- Treat boys and girls the same at work 👧👦
- Keep the air, land, and sea clean 🌍
- Help people who are sick, old, or need extra help 🧓❤️
- Support people who want to start businesses or make things 🛠️

## What About Kids?

- Kids must go to school, and it doesn't cost money 💸
- Malta wants kids to have fair chances when they grow up
- If kids do work, they should be treated fairly, just like adults 👦💼

## A Special Note

## Even though these are really nice rules, they are like wishes Malta tries to follow. You can’t go to court and ask for them — but they still matter a lot 🌟.
