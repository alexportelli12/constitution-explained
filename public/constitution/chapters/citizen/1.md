# Chapter I: The Republic of Malta — Foundations and National Identity

Chapter I of the Constitution lays out Malta’s core identity: as a peaceful, independent republic built on democratic values and Catholic heritage. It includes 6 articles.

## Malta as a Republic

Malta is defined as a **democratic republic** rooted in **respect for human rights** and the **value of work**.

It is also a **neutral country**, meaning:

- It does not join military alliances
- Foreign military bases are not allowed
- Exceptions exist only for self-defence or United Nations missions

These neutrality clauses were introduced during the Cold War and remain relevant today, especially in Malta’s foreign policy positioning 🕊️.

## Official Religion

Malta recognizes **Roman Catholicism as its state religion**. The Constitution:

- Grants the Catholic Church the **right and duty to teach moral values**
- Requires **Catholic religious instruction in state schools**

> Note: While the state recognizes Catholicism, freedom of religion is protected under a different chapter.

## National Symbols

- **Flag**: Red and white with the **George Cross**, awarded during WWII 🚩
- **Anthem**: “L-Innu Malti,” beginning with “Lil din l-Art Ħelwa…” 🎶

## Language Use

- **Maltese** is the national language
- **Maltese and English** are official languages
- Citizens may communicate with the administration in either
- Courts use Maltese primarily, unless Parliament allows exceptions
- Parliament sets its own language rules

## Constitutional Supremacy

This article confirms the Constitution as **the highest law in Malta**. Any other law that contradicts it is **null and void** to the extent of the inconsistency ⚖️.

This clause strengthens rule of law and prevents future legislation from undermining fundamental principles without proper constitutional amendment procedures.
