# Chapter X: The Public Service — Appointment, Oversight, and Pension Rights

## Purpose

This chapter outlines how public officers are appointed, transferred, and disciplined in Malta. It defines the role of the Public Service Commission (PSC), ensures fair employment practices, protects pension rights, and provides legal safeguards for administrative decisions.

---

## 1. Public Service Commission (Article 109)

- The PSC is composed of 3–5 members appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister, who must consult the Leader of the Opposition.
- Members cannot be sitting MPs or public officers, and are disqualified from holding public office for 3 years after their term.
- Members may only be removed in cases of inability or misconduct.

---

## 2. Appointments and Disciplinary Powers (Article 110)

- The PSC is responsible for advising on the appointment, discipline, and dismissal of public officers.
- Although the Prime Minister holds constitutional power over these matters, actual decisions must follow PSC recommendations.
- The Prime Minister may delegate these powers to other authorities (e.g. senior public officers), but only with the PSC’s agreement.
- Today, most appointments and disciplinary decisions are handled by top public officers, but these actions must follow PSC guidelines to ensure merit-based and fair outcomes.
- These provisions do not apply to certain high offices such as judges, the Auditor General, and others listed in the Constitution.

## 3. Diplomatic Appointments (Articles 111 & 112)

- The Prime Minister appoints Malta’s top representatives abroad after consulting the PSC.
- Transfers to international posts must follow the same consultation process or be delegated to qualified authorities, again under PSC oversight.

---

## 4. Pension Protection (Articles 113 & 114)

- Public officers and their families are constitutionally entitled to pensions if eligible at retirement or death.
- These pensions are a charge on public funds and cannot be reduced unfairly.
- While the Constitution guarantees pension rights for those already entitled to them, the government retains the power to set pension rules for future public officers through ordinary law.
- Today, most public officers receive the standard state pension like all citizens.

---

## 5. Legal Immunity (Article 115)

- The Constitution states that courts may not review how the PSC or its members carry out their official duties.
- This aims to safeguard the Commission’s independence.
- However, recent legal practice has evolved—courts have found ways to challenge PSC decisions in specific cases, meaning Article 115 holds less weight than it once did.

## Implications

This chapter reflects a structured balance between independent oversight and executive function in Malta’s public administration. The PSC plays a central role in ensuring merit, fairness, and neutrality in the public service. Although originally designed to insulate the PSC from external pressures, practical and legal interpretations have evolved—demonstrating how democratic systems adapt while still upholding constitutional principles.
