## Chapter X: The Public Service — Appointment, Oversight, and Pension Rights

### Purpose

## This chapter outlines how public officers are selected, transferred, and disciplined in Malta. It ensures fairness, protects pension rights, and grants legal insulation to decisions of the Public Service Commission.

### 1. Public Service Commission (Article 109)

- Composed of 3–5 members appointed by the President on the PM's advice (after consulting the Opposition Leader).
- Members cannot be MPs or public officers and are disqualified from holding public office for 3 years post-term.
- Members can only be removed for inability or misconduct.

### 2. Appointments and Disciplinary Powers (Article 110)

- The **PSC** oversees hiring, discipline, and dismissal of public officers.
- The Prime Minister may issue broad policy directions to the PSC, which must be followed but cannot be legally challenged.
- Exemptions apply to high offices like judges, the Auditor General, and others.

### 3. Diplomatic Appointments (Article 111 & 112)

- The PM appoints Malta’s top representatives abroad after consulting the PSC.
- Transfers to posts abroad must also be done after consultation or delegated to qualified officers.

### 4. Pension Protection (Articles 113 & 114)

- Public officers and their families are entitled to **pension benefits** based on the rules in place at the time of retirement or death.
- These benefits are a **constitutional charge** on public funds and can’t be reduced arbitrarily.
- Conflicts of interest may result in suspension of benefits, but this must follow strict legal and PSC-reviewed processes.

### 5. Legal Immunity (Article 115)

- Courts cannot review or question how the PSC or its members carried out their duties under the Constitution or relevant laws.
- This protects institutional independence but may raise concerns over accountability.

### Implications

This chapter reflects a careful balance between **institutional independence**, **executive oversight**, and **employee protection**. Like similar systems in other democratic countries, Malta’s public service aims to remain politically neutral and professionally administered.
