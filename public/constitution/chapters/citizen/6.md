# Understanding Parliament

## Overview

Chapter VI explains the composition, powers, and responsibilities of **Malta’s Parliament** — the national legislative body responsible for passing laws, holding the government accountable, and representing citizens.

It consists of:

- The **President**
- The **House of Representatives**, elected by **proportional representation** using **single transferable vote (STV)**

## Key articles and principles

- **Article 52**: Sets out how many MPs are elected and how seat distribution works, including special provisions to correct misalignments between vote percentages and seat counts
- **Article 52A**: Introduced to address gender imbalance — allows up to 12 extra seats for the under-represented sex if it falls below 40% of total MPs ⚖️
- **Articles 53–55**: List who can and can’t be an MP, and when someone might lose their seat
- **Articles 56–58**: Outline voting rules and qualifications, including protections against electoral fraud and foreign influence
- **Article 59–61**: Define the roles of Speaker, Electoral Commission, and rules for drawing electoral divisions
- **Article 64A**: Establishes the **Ombudsman** who investigates administrative unfairness

## Law-making and procedure

- **Articles 65–67**: Parliament makes laws while respecting human rights and EU obligations
- Changes to core constitutional provisions require a **two-thirds majority** or **referendum** (Article 66)
- Parliament regulates its own business and operations

## Checks and balances

- The **Ombudsman** operates independently to investigate unfair actions by government agencies
- The **Electoral Commission** ensures fair elections and represents both government and opposition interests
- Rules prevent MPs from holding conflicting roles or acting unethically

## Final notes

This chapter ensures democratic fairness, representation, and government accountability. Provisions such as gender balance, anti-corruption protections, and electoral transparency reflect modern democratic values while maintaining constitutional rigidity for core protections.
