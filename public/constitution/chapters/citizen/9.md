## Chapter IX: Finance â€“ Managing Public Funds Transparently

### Purpose

This chapter defines how Maltaâ€™s government handles, allocates, and audits public funds to ensure responsible and transparent governance.

### Key Elements

#### 1. The Consolidated Fund

- All state revenues are collected in this central fund.
- No money can be spent unless Parliament approves it by law (Appropriation Act).
- There are strict rules ensuring lawful withdrawal of funds.

#### 2. Budgeting Process

- The **Minister for Finance** must present revenue and expenditure estimates each year.
- Supplementary budgets can be presented if needed mid-year.

#### 3. Emergency Spending

- If the budget isnâ€™t ready on time, temporary authorisation allows necessary spending for up to 4 months.
- The **Contingencies Fund** allows rapid funding in urgent situations.

#### 4. Protected Salaries

- Constitutional roles (e.g. judiciary, electoral officers) have protected salaries.
- This ensures stability, impartiality, and freedom from political pressure.

#### 5. Oversight by the Auditor General

- The **Auditor General**, appointed by a two-thirds parliamentary majority, audits all government departments and reports to Parliament.
- Supported by a **Deputy Auditor General**, the office is independent and cannot be influenced by external authorities.
- The **National Audit Office** is the broader institution under which this oversight occurs.

### Implications

- These financial safeguards promote trust, accountability, and democratic transparency ðŸ’¼.
- The Auditor General plays a vital constitutional role in protecting against misuse of funds â€” akin to audit institutions in other European democracies.
