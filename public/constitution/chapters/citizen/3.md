# Chapter III: Citizenship ‚Äì Legal Status and Historical Reform

## Chapter III defines how **Maltese citizenship is regulated**, and outlines the treatment of **Commonwealth and Irish citizens** in Malta. While several articles have been repealed, four main provisions remain active.

## Regulation by Law

**Article 22** states that citizenship matters ‚Äî including how it's **acquired, lost, or renounced** ‚Äî are defined entirely by **national law**, not the Constitution itself.

- **Dual or multiple citizenship** is explicitly permitted under existing legislation
- The Constitution provides the foundation but leaves **practical details to Parliament**


## Commonwealth Connections

**Article 23** ensures that:

- Maltese citizens are **Commonwealth citizens**
- So are individuals from other Commonwealth countries or British subjects under the 1948 British Nationality Act
- The **Fourth Schedule** lists these countries, and the **President** can change the list via proclamation


## Criminal Liability Across Borders

**Article 24** limits when Commonwealth or Irish citizens can be charged in Malta for things done abroad:

- They can only be charged if a **non-Commonwealth foreigner (alien)** would also be charged
- And if the same act would be a crime in the country where it occurred
- This protects citizens from **extra-territorial prosecution** unless clearly justified under Maltese and international norms ‚öñÔ∏è


## Repealed Provisions

The following articles have been **repealed by Act III of 2000**:

- **Article 25**: Citizenship by birth or descent
- **Article 26**: Citizenship through marriage
- **Article 27**: Early dual citizenship restrictions
- **Articles 30‚Äì31**: Former parliamentary powers and interpretations
  These reforms reflect Malta‚Äôs efforts to modernize citizenship laws in line with **EU standards** and global human rights practices üåç.
