# How Executive Power Works in Malta

Chapter VII explains how **executive authority** is exercised in Malta — through a structure that balances symbolic leadership, practical governance, and legal accountability.

## The Role of the President

- The **President** is the constitutional head of state.
- They act mostly on advice from the **Cabinet** or **Prime Minister**, except in limited cases (e.g. appointing or removing the Prime Minister, dissolving Parliament, or appointing the Leader of the Opposition).

## The Cabinet and Prime Minister

- The **Prime Minister**, appointed by the President, leads the **Cabinet**.
- The Cabinet has collective responsibility for the actions of Government and gives direction to national policy.

## Ministerial Appointments

- Ministers must be members of the House of Representatives.
- Ministers’ terms can end for various reasons (e.g. resignation, dismissal, or loss of parliamentary seat).

## Legal and Administrative Structure

- The **Attorney General** handles prosecutions and operates independently from Government.
- The **State Advocate** is the Government’s legal advisor and ensures public interest is respected.

## Senior Civil Servants

- **Permanent Secretaries** manage government departments under ministerial direction.
- The **Principal Permanent Secretary** coordinates government administration and may act as **Secretary to the Cabinet**.

## Oversight and Opposition

- The **Leader of the Opposition** is chosen by the President and provides checks on Government.
- The **Parliamentary Secretaries** support Ministers.

## Constitutional Powers and Discretion

- The **President** may grant pardons or adjust penalties through the **Prerogative of Mercy**, following Cabinet advice.
- Courts cannot inquire into whether the President or Prime Minister followed advice where the Constitution requires it — safeguarding executive discretion in those matters.
