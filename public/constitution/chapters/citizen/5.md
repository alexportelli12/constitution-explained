# Chapter V: The President of Malta – Appointment and Duties

Chapter V of the Constitution outlines the **office of the President**, detailing how they are appointed, their term limits, and what happens when the role is vacant. While largely **ceremonial**, the President plays an essential constitutional role in **representing national unity** and **safeguarding democratic functions**.

## How Is the President Appointed?

- The President is appointed by **a resolution of the House of Representatives**, passed with the support of **two-thirds** of all Members of Parliament
- This **supermajority requirement** ensures the President is broadly accepted across political parties

## How Long Do They Serve?

- The President serves for a **five-year term** and can be **reappointed once**
- They can **resign** at any time by writing to the Speaker of the House
- Parliament can remove the President through a **two-thirds vote**, based on proven **inability or misconduct** — a rare but serious mechanism

## What If the President Is Absent?

- When the office is vacant or the President is unable to act:
  - The **Prime Minister**, after consulting the **Opposition Leader**, appoints someone to temporarily carry out the President’s functions
  - If no such person is appointed, the **Speaker of the House** assumes the role

## Swearing-In and Oath

- Before taking office, the President must take an **oath of office**, as set out in the **Second Schedule**
- Presidents appointed under Article 48 take the oath **before the House**

## Why It Matters

The President ensures the **continuity and stability** of Malta’s constitutional framework. Though the role is not executive (unlike a Prime Minister), it remains crucial during:

- Changes in government
- Signing of laws
- Emergencies or national unity moments

The requirement for a two-thirds vote promotes **cross-party consensus**, reinforcing the non-partisan nature of the office.
