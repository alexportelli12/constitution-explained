# Chapter XA: Local Councils

## Overview

This chapter introduces the constitutional basis for **local councils** in Malta and Gozo. It ensures these councils are legally recognized and empowered through ordinary legislation.

## Key Points:

- Local councils are **legally established entities** that manage community affairs.
- Their **powers and duties** — such as maintaining public spaces, managing local events, and implementing minor regulations — are not fixed in the Constitution itself but delegated by **Parliament through laws**.
- The **election and organisation** of councils is handled entirely by statutory law, allowing Parliament flexibility to evolve the system over time.

## Implications

This constitutional recognition affirms the **importance of decentralised governance** in Malta. While local councils don’t have constitutional autonomy (unlike federal states), they serve a crucial role in **community-level representation** and **public service delivery**.
