# Chapter II: Declaration of Principles – Malta’s Social Commitments

## Chapter II outlines **15 key principles** that guide the Maltese state. These are **not legally enforceable**, meaning you can’t sue the government over them — but they are **constitutionally important** for shaping policies and future laws.

## What These Principles Are

This chapter acts like a **social contract** — a public commitment by the Maltese state to aim for fairness, opportunity, and sustainability.

## Main Areas Covered

### Work and Employment

- Recognizes the **right to work** and promotes fair conditions
- Sets rules for **maximum working hours**, rest days, and **paid holidays**
- Guarantees **equal pay** and treatment for men and women
- Protects **young workers and minors** through age limits and safety laws

### Education

- **Primary education** must be **free and compulsory**
- Deserving students can reach higher education with **scholarships or support**, regardless of income

### Social Protection

- People unable to work must get **social assistance**
- Workers should have **insurance** for old age, disability, or unemployment
- Disabled citizens have a right to **education and vocational training**

### Environment and Culture

- The state must safeguard Malta’s **landscape, cultural heritage**, and the **natural environment**
- It must also support **scientific research**, **arts**, and **cultural development**

### Economic Goals

- The state supports **private enterprise**, **co-ops**, and **artisans**
- Encourages involvement from Maltese citizens living abroad in national life

## Legal Status

These provisions, under **Article 21**, are **not directly enforceable in court**, but they remain **fundamental to Malta’s governance**. Parliament should consider them when drafting laws.
This approach is similar to **“Directive Principles”** in other countries (e.g., India, Ireland), where the Constitution defines goals rather than enforceable rights.
