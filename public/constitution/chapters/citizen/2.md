# Chapter II: Declaration of Principles – Malta’s Social Commitments

Chapter II outlines **15 key principles** that guide the Maltese state. These are **not legally enforceable**, meaning you can’t sue the government over them — but they are **constitutionally important** for shaping policies and future laws.

---

## What These Principles Are

This chapter acts like a **social contract** — a public commitment by the Maltese state to aim for fairness, opportunity, and sustainability.

## Legal Status

These provisions, under **Article 21**, are **not directly enforceable in court**, but they remain **fundamental to Malta’s governance**. Parliament should consider them when drafting laws.

This approach is similar to **“Directive Principles”** in other countries (e.g., India, Ireland), where the Constitution defines goals rather than enforceable rights.
