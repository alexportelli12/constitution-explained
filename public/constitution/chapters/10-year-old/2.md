# Malta’s Goals for a Fair and Kind Country

In this chapter, Malta lists all the important things it wants to do to make life better for people. It’s kind of like a to-do list for the government ✅ — even if it’s not full of laws you can use in court.

## What Malta Promises to Work On

- Helping everyone find a job and learn new work skills 💼
- Making school **free and required** for kids
- Making sure students can go to university, even if they don’t have money
- Treating **girls and boys the same** at work 👩‍🔧👨‍🔧
- Keeping nature clean — air, water, and land 🌿
- Helping sick, old, or jobless people with money and care 🏥

## For Young People

- There’s a **minimum age** for starting paid work
- Young people should get **equal pay** if they do the same job
- Kids and teens are protected if they have to work

## Important Note

These are not rules you can use to win a case in court ⚖️. They are **goals** that Malta tries to follow when making new laws or helping people.
