## How Parliament Works in Malta

### A team that makes the rules

Malta has a special place called **Parliament** where people called **Members of Parliament (MPs)** meet to make the laws that affect everyone. 🏛️
Here’s what happens inside:

- MPs are chosen by citizens through voting in different parts of Malta 🗳️
- If there aren't enough women or men, extra seats are added to balance it out ⚖️
- To become an MP, you need to be **18+ years old** and not have any disqualifications like breaking the law
- A **Speaker** helps guide the conversations, like a teacher keeping order in class 👩‍🏫
- Voting must be done in a fair way using a smart system to count votes
- The **Ombudsman** is like a referee, making sure the government plays fair
  There are also rules about when Parliament starts and ends, how long it lasts, and when elections must happen.
