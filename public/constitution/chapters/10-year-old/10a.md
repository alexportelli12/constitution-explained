## Local Councils: Helping Our Towns 🏘️

### What are they?

In every town or village in Malta and Gozo, there are **local councils**. They’re like mini-governments that make sure your community works well 👍.

### What do they do?

Local councils:

- Organise events like festas 🎉
- Take care of parks and pavements 🌷
- Make small decisions to keep things nice

Parliament writes the rules for how these councils work and who gets elected to them 🗳️.
