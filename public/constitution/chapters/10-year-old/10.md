## How Malta Chooses and Supports Its Workers 🧑‍💻

### What is the Public Service?

Malta has many people who help the country work well, like government employees and workers in embassies ✉️. They’re part of the **Public Service**.

### Who picks them?

There’s a group called the **Public Service Commission**. It:

- Helps choose new workers
- Makes sure people are treated fairly
- Can remove someone only for serious reasons

### Working in other countries

Some workers help Malta in other countries 🌍. The Prime Minister picks them after talking to the Commission.

### Getting pensions

- When workers retire, they may get money every month called a **pension** 💵.
- The pension rules protect their rights, even if they get another job later.

### Legal protection

Courts are not allowed to question decisions made by the Public Service Commission or its members.
