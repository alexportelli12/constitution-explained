# What's in the "Miscellaneous" Chapter? 🧠

This chapter has extra rules that help Malta work better. They cover different topics, like TV fairness and government jobs!

## Some Cool Parts:

- **Anyone** can say if they think a law is unfair — they don’t need to be personally affected 🧑‍⚖️
- It’s **not allowed** to have groups trained to use force for politics ⚠️
- There’s a **Broadcasting Authority** that makes sure what we see on TV is fair and balanced 🎥📰
- There’s an **Employment Commission** to keep job hiring fair 👍
- If someone in a big role wants to leave, they can **write a letter** to resign ✍️
- Rules say how different offices and jobs can be filled or shared 👥
