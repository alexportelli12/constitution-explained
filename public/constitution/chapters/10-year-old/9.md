# How Malta Collects and Spends Its Money 🏦

## Where does the country keep its money?

Malta keeps all its income in a special place called the **Consolidated Fund**. This is like the government’s main bank account 💰.

## How is money used?

- The **Minister for Finance** prepares a yearly plan showing how much money Malta will earn and spend.
- If something unexpected happens, there's a **Contingencies Fund** (like a savings account for emergencies).

## Who gets paid from this fund?

People like:

- Judges
- Important leaders

Their salaries come from the same fund and can’t be unfairly changed.

## Who checks if everything is right?

- The **Auditor General** checks all spending and tells the Parliament what was done right or wrong 📋.
- There’s also a **Deputy Auditor General** to help when needed.
