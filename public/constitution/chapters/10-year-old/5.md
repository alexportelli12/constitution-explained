# The President of Malta

The President is the **official head of Malta**, kind of like a captain who watches over how the country is run. This chapter explains how the President is chosen and what happens if they're not around.

## Who Picks the President?

- The **House of Representatives** (our Parliament) picks the President
- They must agree by a **two-thirds vote**, so most members have to say yes 👍

## How Long Can They Be President?

- The President serves for **five years**
- They can be picked **one more time** after that

## What If the President Leaves or Can’t Work?

- The **Prime Minister**, after talking to the **Opposition Leader**, picks someone to fill in
- If no one’s picked, the **Speaker of the House** helps out

## Starting the Job

- The President must take a special **oath (promise)** before they begin
- This shows they’re ready to be fair and honest ✋
